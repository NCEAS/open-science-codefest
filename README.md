==========================

Web site and planning materials for the [Open Science Codefest 2014](http://nceas.github.io/open-science-codefest). This is an open, community-driven gathering designed to facilitate advances in sustainable scientific software.

# Sessions
We welcome session ideas, whether they are for coding sessions, design, software discussions, lightning presentations, or other productive activities. To propose a session: 

1. Open a New Issue in the ticket tracker
2. Provide the title, Proposer's name, potential participants, and a summary
3. Label the issue as a 'proposed session', as well as with the activity category (e.g., coding, discussion, etc.)
4. Recruit and Revise! Find people with an interest in your topic, and discuss with them how to make it better, until you reach common ground
