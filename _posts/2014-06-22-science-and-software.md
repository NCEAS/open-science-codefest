# Overview
In this session, we will review existing approaches to metadata, and propose mechanisms to extend existing metadata descriptions with semantic annotations.  While hundreds of thousands of metadata documents exist in networks such as the [KNB](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org) and [DataONE](https://cn.dataone.org), these are typically structured natural language.  Embedding semantics that more explicitly links these data to formal knowledge models will signficantly improve our joint ability to discover, integrate, and reuse scientific data.
