## Overview
If you're ready to add semantics to your metadata but you don't know where to start, this session is for you! We aim to examine existing - albeit nascent - efforts to annotate metadata and data to better express its meaning and make it more accessible for discovery and integration.

How do your keywords relate to semantic concepts? 
Can your CSV file really become Linked Open Data?
Is RDFa the way to get there?
So, everything's annotated...now what?

Perspectives from the rEML and SemantEco efforts are anticipated and encouraged.
