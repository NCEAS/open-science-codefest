## Overview
Refactor the dataone R package to natively implement access to the DataONE REST services API within the R language.  The current implementation uses a bridge to execute the Java DataONE libclient library, which is not portable across platforms, and can be fragile to build and install on certain platforms.  By refactoring, all R platforms will be supported through the use of the RCurl library.
