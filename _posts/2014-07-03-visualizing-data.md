# Overview
This session will be a collaborative sharing experience where new visualization tools and technologies are shared with the group. "New" can be something
that was developed recently or an established technology that others are looking to learn.
The focus will be on tools, technologies, and techniques for visualization scientific data or user interfaces for discovering and ivestigation scientific data.
The idea is that each group member will come having something to share with the group or be looking to discover new tools to use for their
own projects. The group will demo these tools and discuss how they could work with our projects.
