## Conference organization

The Codefest will not be run like a typical science confererence, but instead will incorporate elements of an [unconference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference), with the goal of allowing groups with shared interests to connect organically and to work on projects of mutual interest. The conference will be organized to stimulate productivity and community building, while giving ample opportunities for [ignite talks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk) that promote communication among participants as activities unfold.
