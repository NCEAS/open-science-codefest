# Overview
Provide one or more paragraphs describing the session that you have interest in.  Provide details that explain what activities you would pursue, how the session would be organized, how long you expect it might last, and what products would come out of it.  We recognize that all of these proposals can (and should) be modified as the sessions evolove during the Codefest.  Expect others with interest in your idea to propose modifications and take the idea in new directions; welcome this change!
