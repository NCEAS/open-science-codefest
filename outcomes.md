## Outcomes

[Open Science Codefest](/open-science-codefest) was fun and productive, and stimulated collaboration by many scientists and software developers.   Here we highlight some of the major outcomes and products of Codefest, along with some pointers on where to get more information.  We would like to keep the collaborations going!

- [CodeMeta](MetaData-for-Software-\(Code-as-a-Research-Object\)) - Metadata for Software Discussion
    - After a lively discussion about metadata for software, Codefesters developed a crosswalk that compared existing vocabularies, and a plan for developing this into a JSON-LD schema based on prior work
- [OSManuscript](Open-Science-Manuscript) - Discussion and Drafting of an Article Promoting Open Science for Ecologists
    - This activity generated a draft journal article promoting Open Science for ecologists. The discussion was varied and focused on defining open science, listing tools for open science, and processes. The overall notion was that the key element required for open science is to shift the scientist's mindset. Additional discussion delved into more detail about actual tools and the origins of open science.

    - Draft google doc can be found [OSManuscriptlink](insertlinktogoogledochere)
- [ESAOpenSci](https://github.com/NCEAS/open-science-codefest/wiki/ESAOpenSci) - Discussing creating an Open Science Section in ESA
    - The purppose of this discussion session was to review the merits, opportunities, benefits, and potential for implementation of a section in ESA devoted to promoting Open Science. 
    - Among other things this activity has generated an [online petition](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1quEtCE_1lMOnjzhfeaL_xi-yUgndtGfiLKk-EMzuAX4/viewform?usp=send_form) proposing the creation of the Open Science Section and the group has generated a draft set of [ByLaws](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UBASw6gxmfyJXLxyV5Hb8hlTzm7mTN7f8-K1UwKnCC0/edit?usp=sharing).
- [MetaFeedback](https://github.com/NCEAS/open-science-codefest/wiki/MetaFeedback) - Discussion Session devoted to the idea of adding user feedback to data set metadata.
    - The goal of this session is to experiment with ways that users feedback could be easily embedded in structured metadata allowing the provider to identify users and both benefits and issues with the data as well as for other users to learn from past work. 
    - Discussion in this session centered on comparing the relative merits of adding user feedback in the context of traditional structured metadata, versus more unstructured mechanisms, such as blogs, versus other hybrid approaches.
    - The [Open Annotation Data Model](http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/) from WC3 was highlights as a potential means to create structured user annotation content.
    - Outcomes from the session include:
        - A notional idea to look for an opportunity to create a prototype annotation repository that would have an open API which would be queryable from other resources.
        - Etherpad [discussion](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/L14a1H3MrC)
- [Bill's session of tools and data lifecycle]
