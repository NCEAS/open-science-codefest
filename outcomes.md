## Outcomes

[Open Science Codefest](/open-science-codefest) was fun and productive, and stimulated collaboration by many scientists and software developers.   Here we highlight some of the major outcomes and products of Codefest, along with some pointers on where to get more information.  We would like to keep the collaborations going!

- [CodeMeta](MetaData-for-Software-\(Code-as-a-Research-Object\)) - Metadata for Software Discussion
    - After a lively discussion about metadata for software, Codefesters developed a crosswalk that compared existing vocabularies, and a plan for developing this into a JSON-LD schema based on prior work
- [OSManuscript](Open-Science-Manuscript) - Discussion and Drafting of an Article Promoting Open Science for Ecologists
    - This activity generated a draft journal article promoting Open Science for ecologists. The discussion was varied and focused on defining open science, listing tools for open science, and processes. The overall notion was that the key element required for open science is to shift the scientist's mindset. Additional discussion delved into more detail about actual tools and the origins of open science.
