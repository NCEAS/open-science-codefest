## Outcomes

[Open Science Codefest](/open-science-codefest) was fun and productive, and stimulated collaboration by many scientists and software developers.   Here we highlight some of the major outcomes and products of Codefest, along with some pointers on where to get more information.  We would like to keep the collaborations going!

- [CodeMeta](MetaData-for-Software-\(Code-as-a-Research-Object\)) - Metadata for Software Discussion
    - After a lively discussion about metadata for software, Codefesters developed a crosswalk that compared existing vocabularies, and a plan for developing this into a JSON-LD schema based on prior work
